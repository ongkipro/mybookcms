/**
 * The reference store is demo data, and demo data belongs in the database where
 * a merchant can replace it. It does not belong in the product's own code,
 * assets or copy — anything there ships to every install and cannot be edited
 * out of a running store.
 *
 * This has now been found five times, on five surfaces that each looked like
 * the last one: the login-screen artwork (LOGIN-18), the login card's logo
 * (LOGIN-10), the storefront wordmark, the browser favicon used by every admin
 * page, and `robots.txt`, which handed every merchant's crawler someone else's
 * sitemap. Two of those were fixed while the document recording the fix was
 * being written, which is why this is a test and not a note.
 *
 * Tests are excluded: a fixture has to name *some* store, and naming the demo
 * one there is honest. Everything else must resolve identity at runtime.

 * wordmark indirectly, because removing the last hardcoded reference to a
 * store-specific asset is what makes it an orphan.
