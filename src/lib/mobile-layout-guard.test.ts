/**
 * A guard for one specific defect, which has shipped three times in this
 * repository and is invisible to tsc, astro check and every unit test.
 *
 * A `display: grid` container with no explicit column sizes its implicit track
 * `auto`, and a grid item's automatic minimum size is its **min-content** — not
 * zero. `truncate` implies `white-space: nowrap`, so a card containing a
 * truncated title has a min-content as wide as that title unwrapped. The track
 * therefore grows past the viewport, and because these lists sit inside
 * `overflow-hidden` wrappers the excess is clipped rather than scrollable,
 * putting the row's controls physically off-screen with no way to reach them.
 *
 * It has cost real functionality each time: the product, order and shipping
 * mobile lists, then the CRM action group with `grid-cols-5` on a phone, then
 * the permission matrix losing its right-hand role column.
 *
 * Tailwind's `grid-cols-*` expands to `repeat(n, minmax(0, 1fr))`, and the
 * `minmax(0, …)` is precisely what stops min-content from widening the track.
 * So: a grid that is mobile-visible must say how many columns it has.
