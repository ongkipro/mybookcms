/**
 * A short, soft chime for a newly arrived admin notification.
 *
 * Synthesised with the Web Audio API rather than shipped as an audio file: the
 * whole sound is three sine tones, so it costs no request, no bytes on the
 * install's R2 or asset binding, and works offline. An mp3 of the same length
 * would be tens of kilobytes on every admin page load for half a second of
 * sound.
 *
 * The shape is deliberately restrained — an ascending A major triad (A5, C#6,
 * E6) at 70 ms apart, each with a soft 8 ms attack and a bell-like exponential
 * decay, at a low master gain. Soft attacks matter: a square edge on a sine is
 * heard as a click.
