 * real operator, with the correct password, from an address that had never
 * failed. Measured: 10 addresses × 5 (the pair limit) = 50 = the ceiling, after

 * So it denies only an address that has itself failed for this account inside
 * the window. An attacker cannot put a failure on an address they do not
 * control, which leaves the operator a way in from anywhere; a distributed
 * attempt still hits its ceiling on every address it actually uses.
 *
 * lazy: the pair bucket is the real brake and KV cannot make it exact —
 * `checkRateLimit` is a non-atomic get-then-put, so N simultaneous guesses all
 * read the same count and spend one slot between them. It damps sequential
 * guessing, which is what a credential-stuffing script does; it does not stop a
